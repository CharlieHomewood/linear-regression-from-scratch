# linear-regression-from-scratch

The following repository is a short outline of how a basic linear regression machine learning model works, by implementing the mathematics from scratch using Numpy. 

The "lr.ipynb" notebook provides a walkthrough of what linear regression is, how we find the optimal model parameters via gradient descent. The notebook ends with a comparison with the standard scikit-learn implementation of linear regression to demonstrate that both approaches converge to almost identical solutions.

Further additions could be made to improve this model, such as using L2 regularisation, which are not implemented here.
