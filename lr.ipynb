    "Aim: We want to create a  multiple linear regression model predict the `performance index` values for observations from unseen samples. \n",

    " - This involves optimally fitting a straight-line to our features in some $d$-dimensional space \n",
    "    - 5 dimensions in our case, since we have 5 features in our data set and 1 target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multiple linear regression model takes the form:\n",

    "$$ \\hat{y}=Xw + b = w_{1}x_{1} + \\dots + w_{d}x_{d} + b $$\n",

    "     - $\\mathbb{R}$ is just mathematical notation for \"the set of all real numbers\", and $\\in$ means \"$\\hat{y}$ is a member of the set $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ \".\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{y_{1}} = x_{1}^{\\top}w+b \\\\ \\hat{y_{2}} = x_{2}^{\\top}w+b \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\hat{y_{d}} = x_{d}^{\\top}w+b \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",

    "\\hat{y} = Xw+b\n",

    "\n",
    "This is somewhat cumbersome to calculate as it will require optimising $w$ and $b$ separately. It would instead be better to optimise them simultaneously. We can achieve this via vectorisation. We can combine the bias constant into our weight vector and augment our design matrix by appending a column of $1\\text{s}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bias constant is our $y$-intercept for our straight line which we are trying to fit to our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, this is equivalent to translating the straight line up or down according to the value of $b$. Generalised to more than 2 dimensions, this straight line is actually a hyperplane in $d$-dimensions, but the same logic in 2-dimensions still applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can therefore think of this bias term as another weight in our model, but not one which rotates the hyperplane, but instead just translates it. Since this bias only translates the hyperplane, not rotates, it must move every point on the hyperplane uniformly in the same direction (whereas a rotation of the hyperplane would move different points by varying amounts - imagine rotating a line and looking at how far points near the axis of rotation move compared to those further away). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to combine this bias term into our weights vector, we need to provide a constant dimension in our design matrix for the bias term to act along, hence the column of $1\\text{s}$.\n",
